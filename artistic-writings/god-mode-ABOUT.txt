TECHNICAL
---------

You will note that all the CHAPTER directives are the same. This is
because this text document predates the spoken-word directive
processing. I had a separate python script specifically for this
spoken word performance.

In it I realized the importance of having chapters and change-able
pauses, filler word use, speeds, etc. This content made it
crystal-clear eloquent-spoken-word was useful.

CONTENT
-------

The only thing the original had were chapters. Each chapter was an
entry in an array structure. Each had the same padding pause between
the chapter. I have left all the content attempts at introducing
pauses and filler words to show how time consuming and messy it was.

The content itself ranges across a spectrum of third-rail topics from
religon, cosmology, our souls, cybernetics, the multiverse, and the
simulation hypothesis.

I wrote it at the end of a 14 hour work day sometime in 2018 or
2019. I'm happy to hide behind an AI TTS model voice reading it. It of
course only accentuates the nature of the content.
