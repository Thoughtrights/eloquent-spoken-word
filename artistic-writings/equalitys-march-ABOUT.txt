This was a private poem I put together on on Dr Martin Luther King
Jr's Day, Jan 16 2023. I derived it through abstracting words and
emotion from his "I Have a Dream" speech. Those words were then
modernized and brought into the Black Lives Matter movement, mass
protests, and focus. I wrote it to work through feelings.

I am a 50-something white guy. I grew up in semi-urban New Brunswick
NJ. My elementary school was mostly African-American. There were four
white kids - one was my younger brother. I learned a great deal about
slavery. And MLK.

I only wrote this TTS processing system 15 months later. I was looking
for content and saw this journal file. I had never shared it. I did
not write it to speak it. It was an exercise; My imagination of a
speaker at a BLM march.
