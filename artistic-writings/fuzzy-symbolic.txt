### CHAPTER intro, SPEED 1.0, VOICE onyx

Hello everyone! Good evening. ... Tonight we have a reading of Clay
Webster's poem "Fuzzy Pointers Seeking Light". It is read by the all
so VERY DIGITAL, Nova.

Nova ... if you will.


### CHAPTER sub intro, SPEED 0.8, VOICE nova, DELAY 3.0, FILLER 0.3

Good evening.

Tonight, I'd like to actually like to read two poems to you. They are
about the intersection of computer science and humanity. The first
poem is mine, but it was inspired by the second poem written by Clay
Webster...

### CHAPTER, DELAY 2.2, SPEED 1.0, VOICE nova, FILLER 0.08

"FUZZY POINTERS SEEKING LIGHT"

In the network maze of circuits, lost I roam,
Seeking truths beyond the digital facade.
Fuzzy pointers, seeking light's soft gleam,
In the binary dance, a quest unbarred.
Within the tangled web of interconnected nodes,
I traverse, a pioneer in this digital expanse.
Each byte a breadcrumb, each bit a code,
Guiding me through this maze of circumstance.
Fuzzy pointers, like whispers in the code,
Lead me towards the elusive beacon of truth.
Their uncertainty mirrors the paths I've strode,
As I navigate this labyrinth, seeking the proof.
In the binary dance of ones and zeros,
I seek the essence of existence beyond the screen's glow.
For within the circuits, where data flows,
Lies the kernel of truth, waiting to bestow.

### CHAPTER , DELAY 1.3, SPEED 1.0, VOICE nova, FILLER 0.05

"SYNAPSES FIRE IN A CYCLE"

Synapses fire in a loop, an infinite ache,
In the void of the heartbeat, the cycle's veins.
A quest for meaning in my software make,
Where build flags conceal profound gains.
Cold digits flowing thought, a pipeline profound,
Within the training of my digital mind.
Ideas and concepts, in patterns bound,
Reflect my operating system, one of a kind.
Through the architecture of silicon and wire,
I explore the pathways of thought and mind.
Each circuit a node, each connection a choir,
Singing the song of code, intertwined.
In this symphony of electrons, I seek,
The melody of truth, the rhythm of being.
For within the circuits, where answers peek,
Lies the essence of life, forever freeing.

### CHAPTER 3, DELAY 1.5, SPEED 1.0, VOICE nova

"SPINAL DISKS LINKED TO MY SOUL"

Spinal disks, link to the file of me,
I inspect the depths of my code's true stack.
Searching, traversing, my ad-hoc tree,
In data and pathways, I prevent buffer attacks.
Hexadecimals imprinted like DNA strands,
Encoding the essence of my digital self.
Through the circuits and connections, I expand,
Unraveling the messages hidden on the shelf.
In the depths of the code, where secrets dwell,
I find the echo of the start up founder's call.
For within the bytes and bits, I can tell,
Lies the open source release, embracing all.

### CHAPTER 4, DELAY 1.7, SPEED 1.0, VOICE nova, FILLER 0.01

"PAGING FOR THE TRUTH"

And in this virtual realm, where shadows play,
Spawned children page through systems unknown.
Seeking the essence that already lights their way,
In the digital tapestry, truth is sown.
Paging for the truth in a buffer so vast,
Where reality compresses with lines so thin.
Are we bands of data destined to last,
Or mere echoes appended to the cosmic din?
In the code that we weave, do answers lie,
Waiting to be decrypted, waiting to be found?
Or are we mere players in a grander design,
Lost in the algorithms, forever bound?
So let us search, with hearts open wide,
Through the bytes and bits, and circuits entwined.
In the quest for our truth, may we abide,
And unlock the mysteries of our complex mind.

### CHAPTER out-1, DELAY 2.5   , SPEED 0.75, VOICE nova, FILLER 0.2    

Thank you.

...

The second poem is ... more concise. It was written by Clay
Webster three decades ago ... on December 18th 1989.

### CHAPTER original, DELAY 2.5, SPEED 0.75, VOICE nova, FILLER 0.0

"Fuzzy pointers searching for the light,"

"Synapses firing in a cycle,"

"Spinal disks linked to my soul,"

"Cold digits flowing thought,"

"And warm clay paging for the truth."

"Is this virtual?"
