### CHAPTER reader intro, SPEED 1.0, VOICE fable, DELAY 2.5, FILLER 0.2

Hello and good evening. My stage name is FABLE.

Tonight that is very appropriate.

The poem I will read for you tonight is entitled "The Unlikely
Hero". It is similar in form as all those novels following the style
outlined by Joseph Campbell in his book, "The Hero with a Thousand
Faces".

As indicated ... it is written in Quenya. This is only one of
J.R.R. Tolkien's many invented languages. Quenya itself is only one of
his two well-constructed fantasy ELVISH languages. His other Elvish
language is called "Sindarin".

Tonight ... I will be reading "The Unlikely Hero" - written by a
fictional Elf author - in a fictional Elvish language.

I apologize in advance for it being dense, but I hope you can
appreciate its tone and flow. Afterward I will recite the same poem in
the King's English. 

Please sit back and enjoy its rhythm as I twist my tongue in knots.

Thank you.

And now the English translation ...

"THE UNLIKELY HERO: ELENIË OF EÄRENDIL"

In the twilight of evening,
The unlikely hero,
He does not seek glory,
And he does not crave fame.

He walks alone,
Without a shining sword,
The heart of a wanderer,
And the soul of a dreamer.

He is not of noble birth,
Nor of royal blood,
Nor of heroic lineage,
And nor of great strength.

But in his heart burns,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the wind whispers his name.

The trees sing,
Men heed his call,
The fire of his spirit,
Does not fade away.

Under starlit sky,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world awakens.

The elves listen,
To the words of men,
They heed his call,
And do not forget the hero.

The fire of his spirit,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world is changed.

The heavens bow to him,
And the stars shine bright,
The fire still burns,
And under this sky he stands.

For his love is true,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world rejoices.

Elenië of Eärendil,
He does not seek glory,
And he does not crave fame,
Yet the world remembers.

Eärendil's star,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world rejoices.

The trees sing,
Men heed his call,
The fire of his spirit,
Does not fade away.

Elenië of Eärendil,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world is changed.

The fire of his spirit,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world is changed.

For his love is true,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world rejoices.

Elenië of Eärendil,
The unlikely hero,
He walks alone,
And the world rejoices.
