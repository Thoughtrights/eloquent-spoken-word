"EQUALITY'S MARCH"

### CHAPTER, SPEED 1.0, VOICE onyx, DELAY 1.5, FILLER 0.0, MODEL tts-1
We march on, feet weary, hearts heavy,
With the weight of discrimination, racism, and brutality on our shoulders.
People of color, seeking rights and more,
But America's systems, keep slamming the door.

Racism and discrimination, a daily fight,
But the dream of MLK, keeps our spirits bright.
We cash the check, for justice to be paid,
For our bodies tired, from the struggle and crusade.

I can't breathe, you're taking my life from me
I can't breathe, will anyone fight for me?
Equality's march, we won't be denied,
Justice and fairness, our right.

We face the brutality of police, the poverty of our land,
But we'll stand tall, for equality's band.
We'll not rest till the vote is ours,
And we'll sing out, from every tower.

We'll not wallow in despair,
For a brighter day, we'll pave the way,
We'll rise up, till justice is nigh.

We cry out, "I can't breathe",
For George Floyd, and all the others,
Victims of injustice, at the hands of the law.
We march on, with hope in our hearts,
For a nation where all lives truly matter, not just a part.

### CHAPTER, SPEED 1.0, VOICE onyx, DELAY 1.5, FILLER 0.0, MODEL tts-1
Let FREEDOM RING,
From every hill,
Let it ring loud and clear,
For all to hear.
We'll march on, till we're equal,
For a nation where rights are truly equal, liberty.
