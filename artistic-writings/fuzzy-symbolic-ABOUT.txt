The original short poem was written by me on December 18th 1989. It
uses almost exclusively double and triple meanings spanning life,
biology, computer hardware, and operating systems.

I re-imagined this as a much larger poem and used OpenAI's GPT LLM to
assist. It provided a good draft I'd give a "C" grade to. I re-wrote
much of it. I should improve it by shortening it to half its
size. However, I do find its length useful for the purposes of this
TTS demo.
